# Solutions to Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) comrises of a large set of problems that help you test your
current proficiency in coding. If you are learning a programming language and want to test your understanding
of your current proficiency in this langugae, this is probably a good place to start.

This repository comprises (or will comprise at some point) the solutions of the first 100 problems. As mentioned
in the first page:

> Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you 
> are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their 
> solutions to be discussed elsewhere.

Hence no more than the first 100 solutions will be available for public, even if I decide to sole more than
the first 100 problems.

The solutions are present in this Playlist: [Project Euler Workthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqlKxneW-M4&list=PLsI3FQqvQeJKRflgU-VjhKgQ_idef2clg)

The solutions to the different problems are present in the following Notebooks:
